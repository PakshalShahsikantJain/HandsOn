	Program : Design application for income tax department to calculate tax
			  amount. According to the income tax department there is no
			  income tax for the income less than 5 lakhs.

              If income is in between 5 to 10 lakhs then there will be 10% tax.

			  If income is in between 10 to 20 lakhs then there will be 20%
              tax.

  			  And for more than 20 lakhs there will be 30% tax.
			  We have to accept gross income from user and return the tax
			  amount.
